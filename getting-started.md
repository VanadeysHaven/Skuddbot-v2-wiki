# Getting started

## Inviting the bot to a server
There are two options for using Skuddbot in a server. The hosted version of Skuddbot is maintained by the developer and always features the latest updates. This version can be invited to any Discord server by heading to [invite.skuddbot.xyz](https://invite.skuddbot.xyz/). The user may also choose to self-host the bot, instructions for this can be found in the [run it yourself](/Developers/run-it-yourself.md) article.


## Turning on developer mode
Turning on developer mode might be handy while working with Skuddbot. This allows the user to grab the ID's of various things, as the bot sometimes requires the ID of something. The user can turn this on by going to their Discord user settings, and navigate to Advanced and enable Developer Mode there. This will allow the user to right click and copy the ID of just about everything within Discord.
