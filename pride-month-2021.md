## Extra Skuddbux and Experience
Throughout the month of June you can collect an bonus of 10k Skuddbux and 20k experience every Wednesday and Saturday. Every time you do this you also get 1 Pride Flag, up to a maximum of 8. You collect your bonus and flag by simply claiming your Daily Bonus, your seasonal bonus and pride flag will be automatically applied!

## Pride Flags = more Skuddbux and Experience
At the end of the month, on the 30th of June, your pride flags are automatically turned in for an extra bonus of Skuddbux and Experience. All you need to do is make sure you claim your daily bonus on that day! You will earn 10k Skuddbux and 20k Experience multiplied by the amount of Pride Flags you have.
