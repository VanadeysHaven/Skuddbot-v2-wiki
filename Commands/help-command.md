# Help command
## Introduction
The help command shows all commands available to a user. It shows the command with the aliasses, a short description and a Wiki link if applicable.

## Viewing server commands
To view the commands available in a server a user types `!help` in the server they want to view, they will then be sent a DM in which they can view the commands available to them in that server.

### Permissions
They will only see commands they have permission for in that server, so it may be possible that they will see some commands in one server, while not seeing it in another.

## Viewing DM commands
To view the commands available in DM's, the user types `!help` in DM's with Skuddbot. Or they click the ![](https://i.imgur.com/juslF5H.png) reaction if they are viewing server commands.

## Pages
Users can navigate between pages in the help command using the ![](https://i.imgur.com/3pFjjWm.png) and ![](https://i.imgur.com/DkZ1fXh.png) reactions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Due to limitations it is not possible for the bot to delete your reactions in a DM, therefore adding and removing a reaction has the same effect. 
* Due to this same limitation, the reactions won't dissapear when the message expires. The pages will stop working after roughly 30 minutes, after this you will need to use the `!help` command again.
