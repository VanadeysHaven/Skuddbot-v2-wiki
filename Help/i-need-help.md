# I need help!

## I can't find what I am searching for.
There can be either of two thing's going on here, the piece of documentation you are looking for isn't present yet, please search the Wiki first, there is a search bar in the top right. If you still can't find what you are looking for, contact me! You can find the details in [Contact](contact.md).

## Something is unclear in this wiki.
While I am trying my best to explain everything in "plain human language", it could be that a article contains too much "dev rambling", when you feel like this is the case, feel free to [Contact](contact.md) me. I'll explain it to you better, and amend the article!
